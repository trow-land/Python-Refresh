# Object-Oriented Programming Masterclass in Python

This repository contains projects completed as part of the "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" on Udemy, specifically focusing on the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) section. The projects were aimed at deepening my understanding of OOP principles using Python. While certain practices were employed solely for educational benefits, they encapsulate the core essence of OOP.

## Directory Structure:
- **Game Directory**:
  - A simplified game simulation designed to demonstrate the creation of various character classes with distinct attributes and methods.
  - **Key Concepts**: OOP, Encapsulation, Class Imports, Method Overriding, Super Methods, and Properties.

- **Songs Directory**:
  - A program engineered to parse song information from a text file and instantiate respective Artist, Album, and Song objects.
  - **Operation**: Upon execution, the script reads album data from a file, organises the data into a structured collection of Artist, Album, and Song objects, and generates a verification file to validate the operation.
  - **Key Concepts**: Class Definition and Object Instantiation, Encapsulation, Method Definition, File I/O, Data Organization and Manipulation, Utility Functions

- **Account.py**:
  - A class definition for managing a rudimentary bank account, encompassing balance tracking and transaction history functionalities.
  - **Key Concepts**: Class Definition and Object Instantiation, Encapsulation, Method Definition, Static Methods, Name Mangling, Control Flow


- **ducks.py**:
  - A small demonstration of polymorphism featuring 2 classes; Duck and Penguin. The script demonstrates that  the test_duck function still works correctly with a penguin object.
