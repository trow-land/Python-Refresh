# Variables

# We can store data with variables, unlike in c++ you do not need to
# specify the data type of the variable before use

# Variables should be used conforming with the best practices
# Be descriptive with your variable names!
age = 30
print(age)

retirement_age = 60

years_to_retirement = retirement_age - age

print("There are ", age, "years until retirement")


a, b, c = 1, 3, 4  # Allows us to quickly define variable values

print(a, b, c)  # 1 3 4

# Constants
PI = 3.14   # Constant names should be all in capitals (altho it still can be changed)

# Double underscore = dunder
# Do not create a variable with 2 underscores
