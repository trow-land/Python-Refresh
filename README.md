# Python Projects, Programs and Practice

This repository is to colate some of my python specific projects, programs and practice. The majority of my programming recently is tied up in machine learning, data science and computer vision projects but I am going to include more python specific projects. These form *deliberate practice* and a dedicated means to improve my skills and a python programmer which will in turn strengthen my skills as a machine learning engineer.


## Directory Structure

- **Algorithm Practice**: This folder will contain scripts focused on practicing commonly used algorithms such as those you might utilise in leetcode exercises (e.g searches, double-pointer etc)
- **Projects Portfolio**: This contains python projects with a range of difficuilty designed to reinforce skills and learn new ones
- **Subject Refresh**: This is just some really small programs to refresh my muscle memory after a period away from coding in Python.

## Spotlight Projects
