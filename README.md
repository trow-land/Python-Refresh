# Python Refresh

This repository is detailing scripts I used to brush up on my Python programming skills, from the basics of the language to more advanced concepts, including object-oriented programming.

As I had not pragmattically covered python from the basics before implementing machine learning algorithms I thought it would be benefitial to revisit concepts from the basics.

Each Python script included in this repository demonstrates a specific topic or feature of Python, showcasing my understanding and ability to use it. The code is written clearly and concisely, making it easy to understand and follow. Commenting in parts is additional to what is adviced in the PEP8 guidelines because these scripts were writting explicitely for learning. 

Here's a brief rundown of the repository's contents:

1. `args_and_kwargs.py` - Usage and understanding of arguments and keyword arguments in Python functions.
2. `Augmented_assignement_operator.py` - An example demonstrating the use of Python's augmented assignment operator.
3. `break_continue_pass.py` - Illustrates the control flow tools: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.
4. `Built_in_functions_methods.py` - Demonstrates usage of Python's built-in functions and methods.
5. `check_duplicates.py` - A simple script to check for duplicates in a list.
6. `condition_logic.py` - Examples of conditional logic in Python.
7. `DataTypes.py` - Overview of Python's basic data types.
8. `dictionaries.py` - Working with dictionaries, a Python data structure.
9. `Expressions_vs_statements.py` - A brief illustration distinguishing expressions from statements.
10. `for_loops.py` - Demonstrates usage of `for` loops.
11. `functions.py` - Basic function definitions and calls.
12. `functions_ex.py` - A basic functions exercise.
13. `global_and_nonlocal.py` - Explores the `global` and `nonlocal` keywords for variable scopes.
14. `is_vs_double_equals.py` - Difference between 'is' and '==' operators in Python.
15. `Lists.py` - Script that handles lists, another fundamental Python data structure.
16. `loop_christmas_tree_ex.py` - A fun example showing a loop that prints a Christmas tree pattern.
17. `Matrices.py` - Illustrates handling of matrices in Python.
18. `sets.py` - Working with sets in Python.
19. `strings.py` - Showcasing string manipulation in Python.
20. `Tuples.py` - Example using Python's immutable sequence type: the tuple.
21. `variables.py` - Basics of variable assignment and use in Python.
22. `walrus_operator.py` - Example demonstrating the use of the 'walrus operator' (assignment expressions) introduced in Python 3.8.
23. `while_loops.py` - Example of a `while` loop in Python.

Feel free to explore the scripts and provide feedback.

Thanks
